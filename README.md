# Adobe Connect to Kaltura

## Abstract

This code generates MKV files out of AC recordings and [optionally] ingests them onto Kaltura.


**IMPORTANT NOTE: this process was tested successfully on Ubuntu 16.04 against an on-premise Adobe Connect instance. It should work equally well against Adobe's SaaS and may very well work with other modern Linux distros (though it was never tested with anything but Ubuntu 16.04 and so, its use is recommended).
Also, more recent versions of Firefox seem to block the use of Flash entirely. If you plan to use the Flash-based version of Adobe Connect, you should download Firefox 60.0 from here https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/60.0/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-60.0.tar.bz2 rather than use what is currently available from the 16.04 official repos (71.0+build5-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 at the time of writing this).**

## General flow
- Download the ZIP archive and concat the audio FLVs into one MP3 using FFmpeg [this is done in order to determine the session's length so that we know how long to record using FFmpeg's x11grab]
- Using Selenium and Mozilla's Geckodriver, launch Firefox with Xvfb and navigate to the recording's URL so that it plays using the Adobe SWF
- Create the needed pulseaudio sinks so that the audio track can be captured [see `capture_audio.sh`]
- Use FFmpeg's x11grab option to capture the screen display and audio [via pulse]

## Pre-requisites

- cURL CLI
- unzip
- xvfb
- pulseaudio [provided by the `pulaseuadio` and `pulseaudio-utils` packages in Debian/Ubuntu]
- pidof [provided by the `sysvinit-utils` package in Debian/Ubuntu and by `sysvinit-tools` in RHEL/CentOS/FC]
- Firefox with the Flash plugin loaded [tested with 60.0.1]
- Ruby [2.3 and 2.5 were tested]
- Ruby Gems: `adobe_connect`, `selenium-webdriver`, `open3`, `kaltura-client`, `test-unit`, `shellwords`, `logger`
- FFmpeg [with x11grab and Pulse audio support, tested with FFmpeg 4.0.2]
- The Mozilla [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) [tested with v0.20.1]:

## Configuration

When using Ubuntu or Debian, you can simply run `ac_setup_debian_ubuntu.sh` in order to complete the initial setup.

### Flash plugin

**NOTE: As of 2021, the Flash-based interface for Adobe Connect has been replaced with a new HTML-based interface. If you are planning to use this newer interface, you can safely ignore this section.**

In order for this to work, the Flash plugin must be loaded by Firefox.
Download `libflashplayer.so` from Adobe and symlink to `/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/flashplugin-alternative.so`

For example, if you've placed the plugin under /usr/lib/adobe-flashplugin/libflashplayer.so, run:

```sh
# ln -s /usr/lib/adobe-flashplugin/libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/flashplugin-alternative.so
```

### ENV vars

Set the needed values in `ac.rc` and make sure it is sourced before running the wrapper as the
various scripts rely on the ENV vars it exports. You can just add:

```sh
. /path/to/ac.rc
```

to `~/.bashrc`, `/etc/profile` or place it under `/etc/profile.d`

In the event you'd like to use `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` binaries from alt locations [i.e: not what's first in PATH], you can export:

```sh
FFMPEG_BIN=/path/to/ffmpeg
FFPROBE_BIN=/path/to/ffprobe
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE: these vars need to be set GLOBALLY [for the user you intend to run this with, that is]. Setting them in your interactive shell and running `ac_wrapper.sh` will not work. Start a new interactive session and make sure they are set BEFORE running the wrapper.**

### The `AC_LOGIN_REQUIRED` ENV var

If your AC instance does not require the user to login in order to play the recording, you can set the value of `AC_LOGIN_REQUIRED` to false to skip that step.
The code in `ac_new.rb` assumes that the user and passwd text field IDs are `name` and `pwd` respectively and that the submit button ID is `login-button`.
If that's not the case in your AC I/F, you will need to change the code accordingly.

The code further assumes the login URL is:

```ruby
@base_url + "/system/login?logintype=oldstyle&next=/admin"
```

You may need to adjust that as well.

### The `AC_HTML_VIEW` ENV var

In 2020, Adobe Connect switched to a new HTML-based interface that replaces the older Flash-based one.
As of 2021, the SaaS hosted version of Adobe Connect no longer includes the Flash-based interface.
On-premise installations of Adobe Connect may still include the older interface, however, and this is preferable for recordings made before the switch, as there are some issues with playing older recordings in the newer interface.
This ENV var controls whether the script attempts to use the older or newer interface.
If set to `false` (the default), it will attempt to use the older Flash-based interface.
If set to `true`, it will use the newer HTML-based interface.
On newer versions of Adobe Connect, including the SaaS hosted version, it *must* be set to `true` for recordings to be properly captured.

### Generating the recording list to process

`generate_recording_list.rb` can be used to generate a CSV containing the recordings metadata.
It accepts a text file with all the SCO IDs, separated by newlines; i.e one SCO ID per line, makes the needed AC API calls and outputs the data in the following format:

```csv
SCO-ID,SCO-FOLDER-NAME,SCO-NAME,PATH-URL
```

To generate a list of recordings to process, run:

```sh
$ ./generate_recording_list.rb </path/to/sco/ids/file> > /path/to/asset/list/csv
```

### Parallel processing

This code is capable of processing multiple recordings concurrently and the only real limitation is HW resources [namely: CPU, RAM].

In order to process several recordings simultaneously, a wrapper around `xvfb-run` is needed.
`xvfb-run-safe` is expected to be found in a directory included in the `PATH` ENV var. If need be, you can change `ac_wrapper.sh` so that it looks for it elsewhere.

The number of concurrent jobs to run is determined in `ac_wrapper.sh` based on the value of the `MAX_CONCUR_PROCS` ENV var.

## Running

Once ready, run:

```sh
$ ./ac_wrapper.sh </path/to/asset/list/csv>
```

Where `</path/to/asset/list/csv>` is the path to a CSV file in the format described above.

## Output

The resulting MKVs will be placed under `$OUTDIR/$RECORDING_ID.full.mkv`.
Where `$RECORDING_ID` is the relative path for the given recording; i.e: `//sco//url-path` - the last field in the input CSV file.

If the `KALTURA_.*` ENV vars are set, `$OUTDIR/$RECORDING_ID.full.mkv` will then be uploaded to Kaltura.
Full logs are written to `/tmp/ac_$RECORDING_ID.log`. If there's a problem, start by looking there.

If the `KALTURA_METADATA_SYSTEM_NAME` and `KALTURA_METADATA_XML` ENV vars are set, the original creation date of the Adobe Connect recording will be saved as a custom metadata field for the entry. If a metadata profile with system name `KALTURA_METADATA_SYSTEM_NAME` does not exist, it will be created by the script.

If the `SCOID_USER_MAPPING` ENV var is set, the `generate_recording_list.rb` script will use this mapping file to map SCO IDs to new content owners. If the ENV var is not set, the script will default to using the data returned by the Adobe Connect API to set the content owners.

If the `SCOID_DURATION_MAPPING` ENV var is set, the `generate_recording_list.rb` script will use this mapping file to extract recording durations where possible. NOTE: to maintain compatibility with information exported from the Adobe Connect system, the durations in the mapping must be provided in minutes.

If the `KALTURA_ENABLE_REPLACEMENT` ENV var is set, the logic will attempt to replace the content of an existing Kaltura entry with the same reference ID value as the given SCOID, rather than create a new entry. If no entry with a matching reference ID exists, a new one will be created.
